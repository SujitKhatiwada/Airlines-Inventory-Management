USER STORY 1:
As an inventory management user, I can load a flight schedule similar to the one listed in the Scenario above. For
this story you do not yet need to load the orders. I can also list out the loaded flight schedule on the console.

USER STORY 2:
As an inventory management user, I can generate flight itineraries by scheduling a batch of orders. These flights
can be used to determine shipping capacity.
